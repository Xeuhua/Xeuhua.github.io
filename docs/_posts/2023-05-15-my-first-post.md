[When you say nothing at all][Ronan Keating]

You quietly observe the world

No one noticed you

Still you expect responce from people who love you

Even if it's just a smile

Your desire for love is so urgent and restrained

But you don't say anything at all

[Ronan Keating]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IobNcpiwpSc
